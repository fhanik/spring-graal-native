# gs-securing-web

This is the Spring getting started guide for securing web.

Currently the configuration (for native-image compilation) is generated into the project via the run_agent.sh command
(run the command, visit the endpoints and login/out to ensure everything is generated).

TODO The verify script is only checking app starts due to it being more complex to test this kind of security.
